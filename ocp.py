The function animal_sound does not conform to the open-closed principle because it cannot be closed against new kinds of animals.
If we add a new animal, Snake, We have to modify the animal_sound function.
You see, for every new animal, a new logic is added to the animal_sound function. 
This is quite a simple example. When your application grows and becomes complex, 
you will see that the if statement would be repeated over and over again 
in the animal_sound function each time a new animal is added, all over the application.

Another example:
Letâ€™s imagine you have a store, and you give a discount of 20% to your favorite customers using this class:
When you decide to offer double the 20% discount to VIP customers. You may modify the class like this:

class Discount:

        self.customer = customer
        self.price = price

No, this fails the OCP principle. OCP forbids it. If we want to give a new percent discount maybe, to a diff. 
type of customers, you will see that a new logic will be added.
To make it follow the OCP principle, we will add a new class that will extend the Discount. 
In this new class, we would implement its new behavior:
"""

class Discount:
    def __init__(self, customer, price):
        self.customer = customer
        self.price = price
        
    def get_discount(self):

        return self.price * 2

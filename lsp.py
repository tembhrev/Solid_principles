Liskov Substitution Principle
A sub-class must be substitutable for its super-class.
The aim of this principle is to ascertain that a sub-class can assume the place of its super-class without errors. 
If the code finds itself checking the type of class then, it must have violated this principle.
Letâ€™s use our Animal example.

To make this function follow the LSP principle, we will follow this LSP requirements postulated by Steve Fenton:
If the super-class (Animal) has a method that accepts a super-class type (Animal) parameter. 
Its sub-class(Pigeon) should accept as argument a super-class type (Animal type) or sub-class type(Pigeon type).
If the super-class returns a super-class type (Animal). 
Its sub-class should return a super-class type (Animal type) or sub-class type(Pigeon).
Now, we can re-implement animal_leg_count function:
